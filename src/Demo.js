    spend extra rs 30 and buy this rather than buying the other… the common one is Rs 150 while the other 
    which is only given at select channels is Rs 180. Well, it’s really worth for extra Rs 30, as the taste 
    is more refreshing and better.`

    post:`Posting this on condition of anonymity since my landlord is on social media - 
    East Bangalore resident here. We served 2 months' notice to our landlord and vacated the apartment
     one day before the rent agreement expiry. We did not compromise on paying the rent despite the adversities 
     we had faced staying in the apartment and the evacuation during last year's flood. 
     The maintenance went up sometime in between and the owner asked us to "adjust it" from the rent. `
